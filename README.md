# Local First Digital Journal

Originally this journal started as a clone of Scott Tolinsky's replicache/local todo starter. 

I changed a lot and primary change being that I am using InstantDB.

## EMH Digital Meaning

EMH stands for Every Moment Holy. This probably doesn't mean anything to the majority of people who will read this but that is one of the primary points. 

Local First software is many things but most notably is the call to "smaller". 

Every Moment Holy is a journal dealing with making sense of all the moments that seem to have no significance or feel insignificant in life. There are things like "Liturgy for Changing Diapers" and other things, just as an example.

But I decided to start making a digital version because the journal that came out was fantastic but you could only use each day's prompt once and then you would have to by another journal or hand copy it and so on. You get the idea. 

So this is a digital journaling app to reuse and add templates. A very small problem for a particular community. 

## Tech Used

Svelte 5, SvelteKit, InstandDb, TailwindCSS

The app works offline and allows for creating new entries. Auth/Login only works when online but if logged in and going offline you can still do reads and writes.
