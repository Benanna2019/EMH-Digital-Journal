title: Help in Time of Temptation
from: From "A Liturgy for One Battling a Destructive Desire" 
poetry-reading: Psalm 141
prose-reading: James 1:12-15
scripture-callout: Blessed is the one who endures trials, because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. No one undergoing a trial should say, "I am being tempted by God," since God is not tempted by evil, and he himself doesn't tempt anyone. But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desire. Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death - James 1:12-15

Jesus, here I am again,
desiring a thing
that were I to indulge in it
would war against my own heart,
and the hearts of those I love.

O Christ, rather let my life be thine!
Take my desires. Let them be subsumed
in still greater desire for you, until there remains
no room for these lesser cravings.

In this moment I might choose 
to indulge a fleeting hunger,
or I might choose to love you more.

Faced with this temptation,
I would rather choose you, Jesus--
but I am weak. So be my strength.
I am shadowed. By my light. 
I am selfish. Unmake me now,
and refashion my desires
according to the better designs of your love.

Given the choice of shame or glory,
let me choose glory.
Given the choice of this moment or eternity,
let me choose in this moment what is eternal.

Amen.


- Describe the destructive desire you are fighting. Try to identify the lesser cravings at the root of it. Can you identify any patterns in your life that might increase the severity of this war against your heart? 


- Consider practical ways to fight for what is eternal even now in your daily choices. List scriptures, habits, prayers, forms of art, people in your life, etc. who may serve as your allies in this fight.


- Consider James' encouragement. Just as temptation leads ultimately to death, in what ways does fighting this temptation lead to a more abundant life?
