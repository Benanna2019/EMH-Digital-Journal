title: Renewal Amidst Discouragement
from: From "The Liturgy of the Hours: Daybreak"
poetry-reading: Psalm 32
prose-reading: Luke 5:27-32
scripture-callout: Jesus replied to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." - Luke 5:31-32

I am weak and inconsistent,
and often buffeted by fear and pride 
and selfishness. But being impoverished
and ill-equipped as I am, 
I will look to the grace of God 
and to the sanctifying work of the Spirit
to accomplish his purposes
in and through me this day, 
as I, in grateful response,
seek to choose that which pleases him.

I open my heart anew to you,
O Lord, that the love of the Father
    and the life of Christ
    and the breath of the Spirit
would quicken within me
a greater affection for your ways.

Work your will in me.
Lead me this day, Lord Christ,
that I might walk its paths 
in the light of the hope of my 
coming redemption.

Amen.


- What weaknesses and inconsistences burden you in this moment? How do your faults lead you to feel ill-equipped for the tasks ahead of you? 


- How does the life and work of Christ comfort and lead you today? Consider the love of the Father and the presence of the Spirit within you as well. Yours is the forgiveness of a Trinitarian God. What joyful implications might this have for your present situation? 


- Consider the truth that Christ came to call sinners, and that David calls himself blessed to be a forgiven sinner. How might your relationship with the Lord become more intimate through these acts of repentance and forgiveness?
