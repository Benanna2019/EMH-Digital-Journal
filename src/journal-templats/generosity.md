title: Generosity
from: From "A Liturgy Before Giving I"
poetry-reading: Psalm 19:17
prose-reading: 2 Corinthians 9
scripture-callout: Now the one who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will also provide and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for all generosity, which produces thanksgiving to God through us. - 2 Corinthians 9:10-11

In truth, I have nothing but you, O Christ,
nothing that I might call my own.

So let that good confession now 
compel a better stewardship.

First teach me to ttreasure 
you, Jesus, above all things. Then
let that increasing devotion be 
increasingly demonstrated in a joyful 
generosity--for to give is to live out 
the declaration that you alone 
are my provision and supply. I need 
not fear what comes tomorrow.

Let me make each offering without
thought of temporal gain. Let me give
precisely because I have belived 
your promises are true--and let 
my giving be the proof.

Why should I grasp at that which I cannot
keep? This body will sleep in death and what
I now hold so briefly will passs into the keeping
of another. I own nothing here. I have no claim.
Dispel the myth of my possessions, lest they 
taint that better hope of Heaven.

Amen.


- Consider any present struggles you have with generosity. What insecurities or doubts about God's promises do you have, that might lead to these struggles? What truths might you now preach to your own heart to replace those doubts? 


- Reflect on ways the Lord has sustained or encouraged you in your own past acts of generosity. How has God already shown you that nothing is wasted when given to the Kingdom? 


- Consider the generosity Christ demonstrated on earth. Reflect on ways small and large that you might more generously serve others.
