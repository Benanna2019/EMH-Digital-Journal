title: Repentance & Restoration
from: From "The Liturgy of the Hours: Nightfall" 
poetry-reading: Psalm 51
prose-reading: 2 Samuel 11:1-12:25
scripture-callout: Let me hear joy and gladness; Let the bones that you have crushed rejoice. Turn your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt. God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me. - Psalm 51:8-10

Indeed, it was my desire to serve you well
in this day, O God, but I have againt fallen
short of your righteousnes in my thoughts,
my intentions, my actions, and my 
utterances. I have responded at times
without grace. I have chosen sometimes 
that which is unprofitable and which leads
neither to my own flourishing nor to the
proclamation of your glory. Forgive me,
O King, for reasons both knwon and 
unknown. Forgive me for the harms
I have done this day, and for the goods
I might have done but failed to do; 
forgive me also for the constant condition
of my heart, for the self-serving impules, 
inclinations, and desires which stand me 
every moment in need of a savior.

How graciously you receive my repentances.
May the grace of your forgiveness,
which blooms evergreen for all your children,
work powerfully in me, changing me into
a better image-bearer of Christ and
more faithful servant of my king.

Amen.


- Consider those things--done or left undone--over which you feel convicted today. What self-serving impulses might have given rise to these transgressions? Allow time for your words to bring shape to your repentance.


- Consider the grace of the Lord in receiving your repentance. Do not pass lightly over his mercy, but take time to write of his forgiveness and how his kindness shapes your own.


- Reflect on the story of David's sin and his own "journaling" of repentance and forgiveness. What might you add to the entries above after reading his?
