I would that my heart was ever strong, O Lord,
my faith always firm and unwavering,
my thoughts unclouded,
my devotion sincere,
my vision clear.

But it is not always so.
There are those other moments,
as now,

when I cannot sense you near,
cannot hear you, see you, touch you--times
when fear or depression or frustration 
overwhlem,
and I find no help or consolation,
when the seawalls of my faith crumble
and give way to inrushing tides of doubt.

And so, Jesus, I do now the only thing
I know to do.
Here I drag my heavy heart again
into this cleared and desolate space,
to see if you will meet me in my place of doubt.

For where else but to you might I flee 
with my doubts? You alone have the 
words of eternal life.

Amen.


- Here in this place of doubt and raw emotion, what questions do you have for your Lord? What would you ask of Christ, in confidence that he is listening? What do you have to say? Be honest about your pain and confusion. What emotions do you need to give expression to, in order to heave the weight of your doubt over to the hands of your God? 


- Consider times in your life when your heart felt strong and your vision clear. Consider also other times of doubt, mapping out the seasons of your soul. Is there any pattern to the changes and variations? Listent to your life and the shape it has taken. Pay attention to where you are and where you have come from.


- Can you say honestly with Peter that there is no one else to whom you can go apart from Jesus? Why or why not? What does this say of your heart?
