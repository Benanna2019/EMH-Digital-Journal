title: Cultivating Awareness of God's Presence
from: From "A Liturgy for the Writing of Liturgies"
poetry-reading: Psalm 139
prose-reading: Exodus 33:12-17
scripture-callout: LORD, you have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I stand up; you understand my thoughts from far away. You observe my travels and my rest; You are aware of all my ways. Before a word is on my tongue, you know all about it, LORD. - Psalm 139:1-4

Inspire me to tell in words, of the holiness of 
your presence made manifest in all tasks,
at all hours of all days.
    For you, O Lord, are with us always.

Every sphere of life and create is Yours, 
and all are threads of the same bright weave: 
    our goings-out and our comings-in,, 
    our fellowship and our loneliness,
    our youth and our old age, 
    our passions and our vocations,
    our chores and our entertainments.

You are equally present in our failures and in our successes, 
    in our sleep and in our wakeful hours,
    in our tears and inour laughter,
    in our births, in our lives,
and even in the hours of our deaths. 
You are everpresent with us.

You are here. You are with me every moment. 
Every moment is holy.

Amen.


- Consider a season or event in your life in which you easily caught sight of the Lord's presence. What do you think made hte holiness of that moment so visible to you?


- Now consider a season or event in your life in which you struggled -- or are struggling now -- to see the Lord's presence. What do you think might be hiding the holiness of that moment from you? 


- How does Moses's desire for the presence of the Lord relate to your own? How might David's recognition of the presence of the Lord challenge you to recognize every moment as holy?
