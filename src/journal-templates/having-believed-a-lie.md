title: Having Believed a Lie
from: From "The Liturgy of the Hours Midday"
poetry-reading: Psalm 43
prose-reading: John 8:31-47
scripture-callout: Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, "If you continue in my word, you really are my disciples. You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." - John 8:31-32

My heart has been tempted this day
to believe something about myself or others
that does not take into account your creation,
your mercy, your sacrifice, your grace,
your forgiveness, your redemption,
and your unshakeable love, O God.
Remind me again of these truths,
giving me faith enough to believe
and hope enough to choose
to embrace them again and again.

I have been swayed from the place of
resting in your grace today--swayed by shame,
by error, by vanity, by pride, or by love of the
praise of people. Act, O Holy Spirit!
Reveal my error, convict conscience,
and bring me to quick repentance.
Rekindle my affections, restoring them again
to their own one worthy object, who is Christ,
and who alone holds the words of eternal life.

Shape my thoughts, O Lord, by your truth,
even as you shape my heart by your love.

Amen.

- What lies have taken root in your life (or in the lives of those you love) at this moment? What truths of God or his creation are you failing to take into account in believing these lies?

- What might it look like to have faith enough to believe and hope enough to choose the truths over the lies? Be specific in your reflection.

- Consider the freedom that comes with truth and the slavery that comes with believing these lies. How might living free indeed shape your heart and the pattern of your days, as you put aside all falsehood?
