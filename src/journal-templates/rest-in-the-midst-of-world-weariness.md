title: Rest in the Midst of World Weariness
from: From "A Liturgy for Those Flooded by Too Much Information"
poetry-reading: Psalm 63
prose-reading: Matthew 11:25-30
scripture-callout: Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. - Matthew 11:28-30

I am daily aware of more grief, O Lord,
than I can rightly consider,
of more suffering and scandal
than I can respond to, of more
hostility, hatred, horror, and injustice
than I can engage with compassion.

But you, O Jesus, are not disquieted
by such news of cruelty and terror and war.
You are neither anxious nor overwhelmed.
You carried the full weight of the suffering
of a broken world when you hung upon
the cross, and you carry it still.

When the cacophony of universal distress
unsettles us, remind us that we are but small
and finite creatures, never designed to carry
the vast abstractions of great burdens,
for our arms are too short and our strength
is too small. Justice and mercy, healing and
redemption, are your great labors.

Move each of us, liberated and empowered by
your Spirit, to fulfill the small part
of your redemptive work assigned to us.

Amen.

- Take time to list those griefs wearying you in this moment. Lift each one to the Lord in prayer as honestly and specifically as you can.

- Now consider what part of God's redemptive work you might fulfill in these things. Again, be specific. Pray for Christ to guide your discernment as you weigh your role and strengthen your hands for the tasks ahead.

- Consider the reading from Matthew. How does the revelation to children and the relationship between the Father and the Son lead to an easy and light burden for those who choose Christ's yoke? How might this passage help you grow more receptive to true rest?
