title: Desire for Discernment
from: From "A Liturgy Before Consuming Media" 
poetry-reading: Psalm 25:4-5
prose-reading: Romans 14
scripture-callout: Let me hear joy and gladness; Let the bones that you have crushed rejoice. Turn your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt. God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me. - Psalm 51:8-10

O Discerning Spirit, 
who alone judges all things rightly,
now be present in my mind and active 
in my imagination as I prepare to engage
with the claims and questions of diverse cultures
incarnated in the stories that people tell.

Shape my vision by your fixed precepts,
and tutor me, Holy Spirit, that I might learn
to discern the difference between those stories
that are whole and those that are bent or broken.

Guard my mind agianst the old enticement
to believe a lie simply because it is beautifully 
told. Let me not be careless. Give me right 
conviction to judge my own motives in that
which I approve, teaching me to be always
mindful of that which I consume, and
thoughtful of the ways in which I consume it.
Impart to me keener knowledge of the limits 
of my own heart in light of my own particular 
brokenness, that I might choose what would
be for my flourishing and not for my harm.

Amen.


- What beautifully-told stories are enticing you towards lies at this moment? What is beautiful about them and what is deceptive? Clarify this distinction. What about these lies show a bent or broken truth? 


- What does discernment look like for you, in your own life? What specific tendencies or temptations towards broken stories must you fight in your own heart? What might safeguarding your heart against these lies look like? 


- What does discernemnt look like for you as you live in community with others? How might you, in love, help keep others from stumbling--acting not out of legalism, but out of grace?
