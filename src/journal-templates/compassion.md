title: Compassion
from: From "A Liturgy for Those With a Sudden Burden to Intercede"
poetry-reading: Psalm 103
prose-reading: Romans 8:18-28
scripture-callout: As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him. For he knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust. - Psalm 103:13-14

I sense your beckoning, O Lord,
and I willingly respond,
entering your presence
to plead on behalf of another.

Tune my thoughts,
my words,
my empathies
to articulate your greater heart,
your deeper purposes. I yield to your
intentions even unto the breaking of my
own heart for that which breaks yours.

Let this burden remain or return as often
as you would have me carry it again to you.

You are ever at work in this world.
So let my compassion be always active,
and my heart sensitive to your movements,
your promptings, your revelations.

Call us, your children,
always to care for one another
in prayer and in action,
in our various times of need.

Amen.

- Before considering your own place in the narrative of this situation, spend time considering the person you are seeking to love in this moment: their unique story, their individual wounds and desires. Try to remove yourself from the scene and focus entirely on the other. What are their greatest needs in this season?

- Now consider your own heart in this story. What role might you play? How do you see the Lord at work in your own life in ways that might benefit another?

- Consider the compassion of the Lord. Reflect on ways in which your compassion falls short of God's--places where your own desire to bring deliverance detracts from the true Deliverer. Pray that you might keep in step with the Spirit as you imitate the Father's compassion for this individual. In what specific ways might the compassion of Christ be manifest through you?
