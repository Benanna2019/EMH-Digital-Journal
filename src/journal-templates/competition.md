There are, O Lord, eternal patterns--
fragments of the story of redemption--
etched into our competitions--
each small echoes
of the fights that a life of long obedience
to Christ might entail.

Teach me to be
gracious in victory,
and gracious in defeat,
remembering that in this competitive context
I am first your emissary,
a representative of your
emerging redemption extended
even onto the fields of competition.

Let me never love winning more
than I love those against whom I compete.

Let me model what it is to be
one fiercely focused on, and invested in,
the drama at hand,
pushing myself always towards the goal,
and yet ever extending
a humility and graciousness
in keeping with my status
as your servant, O Christ.

Amen.

- Consider the ways you might be sharpened in this competitive experience. Pause from thinking about those you compete against and reflect instead on the ways you might personally seek to improve through this task--physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. If the only one present with you now was the Lord, what would your goal be?

- Now consider your fellow competitors and the whole of their lives--physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. How might you love, care for, and encourage them even in the midst of this competition?

- Consider the goal before you. What might it mean for you to boast in the Lord in this?
