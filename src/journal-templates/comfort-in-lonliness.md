title: Comfort in Loneliness
from: From "A Liturgy Before a Meal Eaten Alone"
poetry-reading: Psalm 27
prose-reading: Deuteronomy 31:1-8
scripture-callout: Lord, hear my voice when I call; Be gracious to me and answer me. My heart says this about you, "Seek his face." Lord, I will seek your face. Do not hide your face from me; Do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my helper; Do not leave me or abandon me, God of my salvation. - Psalm 27:7-9

You created us for companionship,
O God, for the sharing of burdens,
for the joining of celebrations,
for the breaking of bread in fellowship,
and so it is not unnatural
that we should taste a particular sorrow
when passing our hours alone.

Sit with me and linger
in this solitary place, O Lord

In the absence of human companions,
may I know more fully your presence.
In this silence where there is no conversations,
may I more clearly hear your voice.

Use my own momentary lonliness
to work in me a more effectual sympathy
for others who are often alone,
and who long for the companionship
of thier God and of his people.

Let me afterward be more intentional
in the practice of hospitality.
Let me sometimes be the reason
the loneliness of another is relieved.
Meet me now in my own loneliness, O Lord.

Amen.

- How might you use the presence of people, activities, and noise in your life as a means to avoid difficult thoughts, emotions, and fears? Take time to reflect on those things that might rise tothe surface of your heart in this time alone, with the peace of knowing that the Lord is present with you as you process.

- Consider ways others in your life have relieved your loneliness at certain points. In what ways--through what actions or words--did they make their presene gently known to you? Who in your life might be lonely in this season, and how might you relieve their loneliness in similar ways?

- Consider what it means to seek the face of the Lord in times like these. How might you make this a regular habit, even when you are not alone?
