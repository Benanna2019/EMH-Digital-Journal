It is a good, good thing to have a home.

But now that I have gone from it, let me steward
well, O God, this homesick gift, as I know my
wish for what has been is not some solitary
ache but is woven with a deeper longing
for what will one day be.

This yearning to retun to what I knew is,
even more than that, a yearning for a place
my eyes have yet to see.

So let me steward this sacred yearning well.
Homesickness is indeed a holy thing,
like the slow burning of an immortal beacon,
set ablaze to bid us onward.

The shape of that ache for another time
and place is the imprint of eternity
within our souls.

So let those sorrows do their work in me,
O God. Let them stir such yearnings as would
fix my journey forward towards that place for
which I've always pined.

Amen.

- Consider what interactions, encounters, or memories have led you to this current sense of homesickness. What has brought about this longing? Whether in joy or lament, entrust those memories to the Lord's keeping.

- Consider the various homes ou have known--the different places you might sometimes pine for. What elements of those home seem to echo, in a limited and temporal way, the eternal longings in your soul? In what specific ways do these homes anticipate the dwelling place of the Lord?

- Consider the pilgrimage you are taking, much like the Psalmist, going from strength to strength and home to home. In what ways might this moment of homesickness serve as renewal for the journey?
