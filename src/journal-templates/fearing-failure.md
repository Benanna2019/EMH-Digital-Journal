scripture-callout: I am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. - Philippians 1:6

I come to you, O Christ,
in dismay, fearing I might fail
in what is now before me.

Let my fears of failure drive me,
O Lord, to collapse here upon your
strong shoulders, and here to rest,
reminded again that I and all of your
children are always utterly dependent upon
you to bring to completion, in and through
us, the good works which you have prepared
beforehand for us to do. It is not my own
work that is before me now, but yours!

I have but one task:
to be faithful.

The success of my endeavors is not mine to
judge. You work in ways that I cannot comprehend.
And in your economy, there will be no waste.
Even what I have judged as a failure,
You will tool to greater purpose.

Use then, O Lord, even my failures, and my
fears of failing, to advance your purposes in
my heart and in your kingdom and in this
world. My confidence is only in you.

Amen.

- Consider the fears you are facing. What are the ways in which you believe you might fail? What insecurities or doubts are at work in your heart for each one? Seek to hand each fear, with its accompanying doubts, to your Lord.

- Reflect on times in your life when you have failed by your own standards. How did you see the Lord over time bringing fruitfulness even from what you had judged as failure? In what ways are you still waiting on him to redeem those old moments of fear?

- What might your one task--to be faithful--look like right now? In what specific ways is the Lord inviting you to invest in his economy of grace, mercy, and redemption?
