title: Missing Someone
from: From "A Liturgy for Missing Someone"
poetry-reading: Proverbs 17:17
prose-reading: John 16:16-22
scripture-callout: So you also have sorrow now. But I will see you again. Your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you - John 16:22

You created our hearts for unbroken fellowship.
Yet the constraints of time and place, and the
stuttering rhythms of life in a fallen world
dictate that all fellowships in these days
will at times be broken or incomplete.

I acknowledge, O Lord, that it is
a right and a good thing to miss deeply
those whom I love but with whom
I cannot be physically present.
Grant me, therefore, courage to love well
even in this time of absence.

I praise you, knowing that these glad
aches are a true measure of the bonds
you have wrought between our hearts.

Use even this sadness to carve out spaces
in my soul where still greater repositories of
holy affection might be held, unto the end that
we might better love, in times of absence and in
times of presence alike.

How I look forward, O Lord, to the day
when all our fellowships will be restored,
eternal and unbroken.

Amen.

- Reflect in gratitude on the person you miss in this moment. In what ways do you see God in them? Thank the Lord for the unique ways he has revealed himself to you through this divine image-bearer.

- Reflect also on memories and seasons the two of you have shared together. How have you walked alongside one another? Thank the Lord also for granting you these moments in which you were not alone.

- Consider ways in which you might love or honor this person, even when you are not physically present with them. Look specifically for ways that acknowledge and celebrate your unique relationship with them and the unique space that exists between the two of you that no one else shares.
